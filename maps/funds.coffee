    snippet: 'Formal education has been transformed by lifelong learning enabled by the democratization of knowledge through online courses and other forms of on-demand skill acquisition. Continuous learning has replaced credentialing, removing traditional barriers to education and forcing universities to update their business models. Career paths have become less linear.'
    essay: "Åzone Futures Market is at once an exhibition and an educational apparatus. Certain behaviors were built in from the beginning to allow it to function like contemporary financial markets, and as such, to be exploited like them as well. This was by design to demonstrate the activities in the markets that shape our world and their consequences. A major part of the exhibition is how the market will evolve over time to account for these exploits.

    In the first few days of operations, a number of bots have flooded the market. This has destroyed the ability to create meaningful prices that reflect the aggregate worldviews of human investors, and undermined the value of hot tips. This mirrors the activity of high frequency trading (HFT), the superfast computer driven trading that has come to dominate current financial markets. HFT makes it increasingly difficult for regular investors to achieve profits in the market, in part by abstracting the value of the underlying asset. When you invest in a publicly listed company today on an exchange that allows HFT, part of the price is created by software run by advanced traders like banks and hedge funds that responds to activity in the market more than to the health of the company. The result is a market that is a playground for those with capital and technical means to get rich off of everyone else’s money rather than a reflection of the value of the companies that are being invested in.
