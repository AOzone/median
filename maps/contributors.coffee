    bio: Jenna Sutela is an artist and writer based between Helsinki and Berlin. Her projects seek to identify and react to precarious social and material momentsâ€”most recently, the relationship between the body and its technologically-mediated environment. She is a contributor to several international publications, such as _Frieze_ and _Harvard Design Magazine_, and her work has been presented at, for example, _Haus der Kulturen der Welt_, _Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma_ and _South London Gallery_.
