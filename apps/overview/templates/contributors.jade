      | A wide range of contributors—from artists and architects to strategists and theorists—have been invited to intervene in the market to transform its architecture as the activity in it evolves. Once the market has stabilized, new financial instruments, visual analyses, incentives, notifications, and hacks such as trading robots will be released periodically. These contributions will be announced on the #[em Åzone Review] and as they are released.
